TODO: WRITE THIS (include walkthrough for how to compile the source code)

Note - Source_Code folder is just source code, does not need to be downloaded... It should already be all compiled and ready in the Download folder

I want examples, downloadable code packages, and source code on here

Final update to add paper once it is done

Release (make branch for just packaged useable code)

Talk about everything in the github

Link every example (knot homotopy, manifold homotopy left)

Add results for Knot Homotopy, manifold homotopy

Include python examples using my precompiled c++
